# HTML/CSS Basics Lesson

This project contains exercises to practice fundamental HTML and CSS concepts. Follow the instructions for each exercise precisely. The automated tests will check your work against these exact requirements.

## Exercises

### 1. Basic HTML Structure
- **Task 1.1**: In `index.html`, set the page `<title>` to `My Learning Journey`.
- **Task 1.2**: Inside the `<header>`, add an `<h1>` element with the exact text `Welcome to My Website`.
- **Task 1.3**: Inside the `<section>` with the `id` of `introduction`, add a `<p>` element containing at least 20 characters of text.

### 2. Styling with CSS
- **Task 2.1**: In `styles.css`, select the `body` and set its `background-color` to `#f0f0f0`.
- **Task 2.2**: For the `h1` element, set the `color` to `blue` and use `text-align` to center it.
- **Task 2.3**: For all `<p>` elements, set a `padding` of `10px` and a `margin` of `20px`.

### 3. Navigation Menu
- **Task 3.1**: Inside the `<nav>` element, create an unordered list (`<ul>`) containing exactly three list items (`<li>`), each with a nested anchor tag (`<a>`).
- **Task 3.2**: In `styles.css`, style the `nav ul` to have `list-style-type: none`. Then, style the `nav li` elements to have a `display` of `inline-block` and a `margin-right` of `15px`.

### 4. Responsive Image Gallery
- **Task 4.1**: Inside the `div` with the class `gallery-grid`, add exactly six `<img>` elements. You can leave the `src` attribute empty for now.
- **Task 4.2**: In `styles.css`, style the `.gallery-grid` class to have a `display` of `grid`.
